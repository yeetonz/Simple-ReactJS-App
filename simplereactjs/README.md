# A simple ReactJS Crypto API website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
We're using CoinGecko API in order to retrieve information regarding coins that are on the market (limit has been set to 100, you can change it on the API),
If the API is not working by the time you're downloading this then just update the link from [CoinGecko API Documentation](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation)

Disclaimer: I am not a professional of ReactJS/CSS so do expect mistakes :D
